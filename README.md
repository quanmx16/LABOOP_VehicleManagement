Mr. QuanMX plans to develop a program to manage the vehicles in his show room. Vehicles have many properties in common. This management program needs to have basic functions such as: add, edit, delete, search. The program must be designed so that adding a new vehicle is easy. Let's build your idea based OOP model.
Program Specifications

Each menu choice should invoke an appropriate function to perform the selected menu item. Your program must display the menu after each task and wait for the user to select another option until the user chooses to quit the program. All vehicle's information in the show room is contained in file vehicles.txt.
In the current stage, the show room has 2 groups of vehicle as follows:

– Motorbike: have the properties such id, name, color, price, brand, speed, require license or not require. In this group has especial function is makeSound which print out the message “Tin tin tin".
